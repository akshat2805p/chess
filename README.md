 Chess Game in C++

This project is a fully functional chess game built in C++, featuring efficient move validation and game logic implementation. It adheres to standard chess rules, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. The code follows an object-oriented approach, optimizing memory management and algorithm efficiency. This project serves as a great foundation for learning game development concepts in C++ and exploring AI-driven move prediction.

 Advantages:
- Efficient Move Processing – Implements optimized algorithms for validating legal moves.
- Object-Oriented Design – Uses structured classes for better code readability and maintainability.
- Standard Chess Rules – Supports advanced rules such as castling and en passant.
- Expandable Codebase – Can be integrated with AI-based decision-making for automated gameplay.

 Potential Drawbacks:
- GUI Limitations – If the project lacks graphical elements, it may rely on console-based interaction.
- Complexity in AI Integration – Implementing an intelligent chess engine requires advanced AI techniques.
- Debugging Challenges – Chess logic can be tricky, especially when handling edge cases like stalemate and checkmate conditions.
